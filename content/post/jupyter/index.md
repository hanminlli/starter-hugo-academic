After graduating with Master of Engineering degree at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/) in December 2022, I became a Ph.D. student here majored in computer science under the supervision of Prof. [Peter Richt√°rik](https://richtarik.org/). My research interests include optimization, federated learning and machine learning.
